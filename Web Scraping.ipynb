      "{'Contents': [], 'History': ['Python was conceived in the late 1980s[43] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[44] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[13] Its implementation began in December\\xa01989.[45] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his \"permanent vacation\" from his responsibilities as Python\\'s \"benevolent dictator for life\", a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project\\'s chief decision-maker.[46] In January\\xa02019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.[47][48]\\n', 'Python\\xa02.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support.[49] Python\\xa03.0, released on 3 December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python\\xa02.6.x[50] and 2.7.x. Releases of Python\\xa03 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python\\xa02 code to Python\\xa03.[51]\\n', \"Python\\xa02.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python\\xa03.[52][53] No further security patches or other improvements will be released for it.[54][55] Currently only 3.8 and later are supported (2023 security issues were fixed in e.g. 3.7.17, the final 3.7.x release[56]). In 2021, Python\\xa03.9.2 and 3.8.8 were expedited[57] as all versions of Python (including 2.7[58]) had security issues leading to possible remote code execution[59] and web cache poisoning.[60]\\n\", 'In 2022, Python\\xa03.10.4 and 3.9.12 were expedited[61] and 3.8.13, because of many security issues.[62] When Python\\xa03.9.13 was released in May 2022, it was announced that the 3.9 series (joining the older series 3.8 and 3.7) would only receive security fixes in the future.[63] On September 7, 2022, four new releases were made due to a potential denial-of-service attack: 3.10.7, 3.9.14, 3.8.14, and 3.7.14.[64][65]\\n', 'As of November\\xa02022,[update] Python\\xa03.11 is the stable release. Notable changes from 3.10 include increased program execution speed and improved error reporting.[66]\\n', \"Since 27\\xa0June\\xa02023[update], Python 3.8 is the oldest supported version of Python (albeit in the 'security support' phase), due to Python 3.7 reaching end-of-life.[67]\\n\", 'The first release candidate of Python 3.12 was offered on 6 August 2023.\\n', 'Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of their features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including metaprogramming[68] and metaobjects).[69] Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract[70][71] and logic programming.[72]\\n', 'Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management.[73] It uses dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.\\n', 'Its design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has filter,mapandreduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions.[74] The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.[75]\\n', 'Its core philosophy is summarized in the document The Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as:[76]\\n', \"Rather than building all of its functionality into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible via modules. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite approach.[43]\\n\", 'Python strives for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. In contrast to Perl\\'s \"there is more than one way to do it\" motto, Python embraces a \"there should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it\"  philosophy.[76] Alex Martelli, a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book author, wrote: \"To describe something as \\'clever\\' is not considered a compliment in the Python culture.\"[77]\\n', \"Python's developers strive to avoid premature optimization and reject patches to non-critical parts of the CPython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity.[78] When speed is important, a Python programmer can move time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C; or use PyPy, a just-in-time compiler. Cython is also available, which translates a Python script into C and makes direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter.\\n\", 'Python\\'s developers aim for it to be fun to use. This is reflected in its name—a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python[79]—and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as the use of the terms \"spam\" and \"eggs\" (a reference to a Monty Python sketch) in examples, instead of the often-used \"foo\" and \"bar\".[80][81]\\n', 'A common neologism in the Python community is pythonic, which has a wide range of meanings related to program style. \"Pythonic\" code may use Python idioms well, be natural or show fluency in the language, or conform with Python\\'s minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. Code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic.[82][83]\\n', 'Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered and often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but rarely used. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.[84]\\n', \"Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block.[85] Thus, the program's visual structure accurately represents its semantic structure.[86] This feature is sometimes termed the off-side rule. Some other languages use indentation this way; but in most, indentation has no semantic meaning. The recommended indent size is four spaces.[87]\\n\", \"Python's statements include:\\n\", 'The assignment statement (=) binds a name as a reference to a separate, dynamically allocated object. Variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object. In Python, a variable name is a generic reference holder without a fixed data type; however, it always refers to some object with a type. This is called dynamic typing—in contrast to statically-typed languages, where each variable may contain only a value of a certain type.\\n', \"Python does not support tail call optimization or first-class continuations, and, according to Van Rossum, it never will.[90][91] However, better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided by extending Python's generators.[92] Before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; data was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python\\xa02.5 on, it is possible to pass data back into a generator function; and from version 3.3, it can be passed through multiple stack levels.[93]\\n\", \"Python's expressions include:\\n\", 'In Python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as Common Lisp, Scheme, or Ruby. This leads to duplicating some functionality. For example:\\n', 'Statements cannot be a part of an expression—so list and other comprehensions or lambda expressions, all being expressions, cannot contain statements. A particular case is that an assignment statement such as a = 1 cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement. This has the advantage of avoiding a classic C error of mistaking an assignment operator = for an equality operator == in conditions: if (c = 1) { ... } is syntactically valid (but probably unintended) C code, but if c = 1: ... causes a syntax error in Python.\\n', \"Methods on objects are functions attached to the object's class; the syntax instance.method(argument) is, for normal methods and functions, syntactic sugar for Class.method(instance, argument). Python methods have an explicit self parameter to access instance data, in contrast to the implicit self (or this) in some other object-oriented programming languages (e.g., C++, Java, Objective-C, Ruby).[102] Python also provides methods, often called dunder methods (due to their names beginning and ending with double-underscores), to allow user-defined classes to modify how they are handled by native operations including length, comparison, in arithmetic operations and type conversion.[103]\\n\", 'Python uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked at compile time; rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that it is not of a suitable type. Despite being dynamically typed, Python is strongly typed, forbidding operations that are not well-defined (for example, adding a number to a string) rather than silently attempting to make sense of them.\\n', 'Python allows programmers to define their own types using classes, most often used for object-oriented programming. New instances of classes are constructed by calling the class (for example, SpamClass() or EggsClass()), and the classes are instances of the metaclass type (itself an instance of itself), allowing metaprogramming and reflection.\\n', 'Before version\\xa03.0, Python had two kinds of classes (both using the same syntax): old-style and new-style,[104] current Python versions only support the semantics new style.\\n', \"Python supports gradual typing.[105] Python's syntax allows specifying static types, but they are not checked in the default implementation, CPython. An experimental optional static type-checker, mypy, supports compile-time type checking.[106]\\n\", 'Python has the usual symbols for arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), the floor division operator // and the modulo operation % (where the remainder can be negative,  e.g. 4\\xa0% -3 == -2). It also has ** for exponentiation, e.g. 5**3 == 125 and 9**0.5 == 3.0, and a matrix‑multiplication operator @ .[110] These operators work like in traditional math; with the same precedence rules, the operators infix (+ and - can also be unary to represent positive and negative numbers respectively).\\n', 'The division between integers produces floating-point results. The behavior of division has changed significantly over time:[111]\\n', 'In Python terms, / is true division (or simply division), and // is floor division. / before version 3.0 is classic division.[111]\\n', 'Rounding towards negative infinity, though different from most languages, adds consistency. For instance, it means that the equation (a + b)//b == a//b + 1 is always true. It also means that the equation b*(a//b) + a%b == a is valid for both positive and negative values of a. However, maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of a%b is, as expected, in the half-open interval [0, b), where b is a positive integer, it has to lie in the interval (b, 0] when b is negative.[112]\\n', 'Python provides a round function for rounding a float to the nearest integer. For tie-breaking, Python\\xa03 uses round to even: round(1.5) and round(2.5) both produce 2.[113] Versions before 3 used round-away-from-zero: round(0.5) is 1.0, round(-0.5) is −1.0.[114]\\n', 'Python allows Boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general use in mathematics. For example, the expression a < b < c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c.[115] C-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in C, the expression would first evaluate a < b, resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with c.[116]\\n', 'Python uses arbitrary-precision arithmetic for all integer operations. The Decimal type/class in the decimal module provides decimal floating-point numbers to a pre-defined arbitrary precision and several rounding modes.[117] The Fraction class in the fractions module provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers.[118]\\n', \"Due to Python's extensive mathematics library, and the third-party library NumPy that further extends the native capabilities, it is frequently used as a scientific scripting language to aid in problems such as numerical data processing and manipulation.[119][120]\\n\", 'Hello world program:\\n', 'Program to calculate the factorial of a positive integer:\\n', \"Python's large standard library[121] provides tools suited to many tasks and is commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths.

It includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary-precision decimals,[122] manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing.\\n\", 'Some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications—for example, the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) implementation wsgiref follows PEP 333[123]—but most are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites.
